Dear Dorotea and Dr. Loubani:

This pertains to the interim order application for the above device.  We require the following information to complete our assessment: 

1)     Since some components are 3D printed, provide biocompatibility testing results for any identified risks as per ISO 18562-1 and 10993-1.
2)     Can you comment on what the impact on patients sleep and ability to communicate, or to remove the mask without assistance?
3)     Are there any issues with rebreathing carbon dioxide?
4)     Where is the expired breath vented to following the HEPA filters shown in your picture provided for the setup.

Please contact me if you have additional questions.

Sincerely,

Melinda
