## 1. ISO 17510:2015 Report
Testing performed 29 September - 30 October 2020, by Vahid Anwari and Azad Mashari at Toronto General Hospital and Thornhill Laboratories, under supervison of Azad Mashari MD FRCPC, Staff Anesthesiologist, Toronto General Hospital, University Network. 

### General Set-up
#### Head Phantom
A head phantom was custom built by silicon casting from 3D printed molds (figure 1.1). The phantom was equipped with two sensor ports: 
1. A reversed standard 22 mm airway taper at the mouth allowing an in-line pressure/flow sensor to be inserted from the back.
2. A pressure or gas sampling port at the nose, consisting of the barrel of a 3 ml syringe connected to pressure tubing with a luer connector.

***Fig 1.2**. Test phantom - rear view Airway tubing is connected to FluxMed sensor. Sample tubes for the FluxMed and the pressure/gas sensor pass through the bottom of the neck*.

#### Viral filters
System was tested with two different viral filters compatible with the the ARM. These models were selected due to their availability and their low flow resistance values. Flo-Guard has the lowest resistance in an N95 filter. Hydro-Guard Mini has a resistance value typical of most models on the market.

***Fig B1**. Exhaust flow testing set-up with Hydro-mini filter. FluxMed sensor is connected at patient connection port. Wall oxygen (via a sequence of adapters) is connected to FluxMed. Flow readings are recoded from FluxMed sensor. Connection sequence: Seal - Mask - Gasket - Adaptor - Filter (Flo-Guard | Hydro-Guard Mini) - Asphyxiation valve ( No | Yes ) - FluxMed sensor - Flow source*

#### Procedure
1. Sensor was positioned at the Patient Connection Port 
2. To exclude flow source, the patient interface was sealed with plastic wrap (between the head mannequin and the mask)
3. Flow rate was adjusted to achieve the minimum pressure (5 cm H2O) in the RATED pressure range (0-40 cm H2O), pressure was measured at this point. 
4. Step 3 was repeated at the following pressures: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 cm H2O.
5. Flow rates were averaged over 10 seconds at sampling frequency of 8 Hz

Tuesday 29 Sept 2020. Toronto General Hospital

#### Objective
Determine the pressures at which the anti-asphyxia valve opens and closes to atmosphere 
#### Apparatus & Set-up
![D1. Annex D test set-up](https://i.imgur.com/z9kxO13.jpg)
***Fig D1**. Anti-asphyxia valve opening and closing pressure measurement set-up*.
#### Procedure
##### Opening Pressure
Set up is shown in figure D1, the FluxMed sensor was attached between anti-asphyxia valve and flow source. 

Pressure was increased until the anti-asphyxia valve closed to atmosphere, the closing pressure was recorded.  Pressure was then decreased until the valve opened, the opening pressure was recorded.  The test was repeated for both the Flo-Guard and Hydro-Guard filters.

##### Closing Pressure
Starting with no flow and the anti-asphyxia valve open, flow was gradually increased until valve closure. Pressure at closure was documented for each filter.

## Clinical Trial
### Objective
To evaluate the effective leakage of the ARM compared to current standard of care NIV masks in patients undergoing emergent CPAP or BiPAP treatment.

### Methods
Opportunistic randomized controlled trial.

After [HSREB approval at Western University](https://github.com/GliaX/Aerosol-Reducing-Mask/blob/master/ethics_application/2020-04-27%20Ethics%20Approval.pdf) participants determined to require non-invasive ventilation by attending MDs in the emergency departments of affiliated teaching hospitals were recruited and randomized to the ARM or control standard mask ([Fisher & Paykel RT043M non-vented mask with anti-asphyxiation valve](https://www.fphcare.com/en-ca/hospital/adult-respiratory/noninvasive-ventilation/rt043/)).

Patients requiring NIV for an actue indications were assessed for inclusion. Exclusion criteria were: Age <18 years; respiratory failure due to non-pulmonary pathology; impaired level of consciousness (Glasgow coma scale <10); upper gastrointestinal bleeding; Chest trauma; Agitatation or violence.

Patients were ventialted using a Resmed (San Diego, US) Stellar 150 Non-invasive ventilator. The device's internal leak logging system was used to document mask leak. Trial was continued until either NIV was no longer deemed medically indicated by the attending team to a maximum of 24 hours. Arterial or venous blood gases collected during routine care of the patient were monitored to ensure adequacy of ventilation.

Primary end-point was proportion of time under treatment with mask leak < 0.5 L/min (registering as 0 L/min by machine). Secondary end-points included ulceration score (National Advisory Panel on Pressure Ulcer Scale), mask fit (Likert-like 5 point scale, 1 = poor; 5 = excellent); and patient tolerance of the device (1 = poor; 5 = excellent).

Additional collected data included: demographics (age, sex); morphologic parameters (height, weight, presence of dentures, facial hair); metabolic data (arterial or venous blood gas); vital signs (temperature, pulse, respirations, blood pressure, oxygen saturation); Ventilation parameters (mode, IPAP, EPAP) and fit and comfort (mask fit evaluated by RT, and patient tolerance of mask).

## Results
The study was stopped after randomization of 16 patient (6 intervention, 10 control) due to results suggesting failure of the ARM to reduce leaks compared to the control device (Fig T1 & T2).

There were no major adverse events during the trial related to the device.
