# Glia-ARM Clinical Trial Summary Report of Leak Data

Source: https://hackmd.io/@ARM/HyMZ32JnP

## Objective
To evaluate the effective leakage of the ARM compared to current standard of care NIV masks in patients undergoing emergent CPAP or BiPAP treatment.

## Methods
<small>The study was an opportunistic randomized controlled trial.

After [HSREB approval at Western University](https://github.com/GliaX/Aerosol-Reducing-Mask/blob/master/ethics_application/2020-04-27%20Ethics%20Approval.pdf) participants determined to require non-invasive ventilation by attending MDs in the emergency departments of affiliated teaching hospitals were recruited and randomized to the ARM or control standard mask ([Fisher & Paykel RT043M non-vented mask with anti-asphyxiation valve](https://www.fphcare.com/en-ca/hospital/adult-respiratory/noninvasive-ventilation/rt043/)).

Patients requiring NIV for an actue indications were assessed for inclusion. Exclusion criteria were: Age $\lt$ 18 years; respiratory failure due to non-pulmonary pathology; impaired level of consciousness (Glasgow coma scale $\lt$ 10); upper gastrointestinal bleeding; Chest trauma; Agitatation or violence.

Patients were ventialted using a Resmed (San Diego, US) Stellar 150 Non-invasive ventilator. The device's internal leak logging system was used to document mask leak. Trial was continued until either NIV was no longer deemed medically indicated by the attending team to a maximum of 24 hours. Arterial or venous blood gases collected during routine care of the patient were monitored to ensure adequacy of ventilation.

Primary end-point was proportion of time under treatment with mask leak $\lt$ 0.5 L/min (registering as 0 L/min by machine). Secondary end-points included ulceration score (National Advisory Panel on Pressure Ulcer Scale), mask fit (Likert-like 5 point scale, 1 = poor; 5 = excellent); and patient tolerance of the device (1 = poor; 5 = excellent).

Additional collected data included: demographics (age, sex); morphologic parameters (height, weight, presence of dentures, facial hair); metabolic data (arterial or venous blood gas); vital signs (temperature, pulse, respirations, blood pressure, oxygen saturation); Ventilation parameters (mode, IPAP, EPAP) and fit and comfort (mask fit evaluated by RT, and patient tolerance of mask).

## Results
The study was stopped after randomization of 16 patient (6 intervention, 10 control) due to results suggesting failure of the ARM to reduce leaks compared to the control device (Fig T1 & T2).

There were no major adverse events during the trial related to the device.
